Sure! Here's an example README file for your Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe game on GitHub:

# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that combines elements of classical Tic-Tac-Toe with quantum mechanics. It introduces two game modes: Superposition and Entanglement, each offering a unique gameplay experience. This README file provides an overview of the game and instructions on how to use it.

## Game Modes

### Superposition

In the Superposition game mode, players can make three types of moves:

1. **Classical Move**: This is a regular move where players place their symbols (X or O) on the board, just like in classical Tic-Tac-Toe.

2. **Superposition Move**: This move leverages the principles of quantum superposition. Players can place their symbol in multiple positions on the board simultaneously, creating a superposition of states.

3. **Measurement Move**: After placing the symbols in a superposition, players need to perform a measurement move to collapse the superposition into a single position on the board.

### Entanglement

In the Entanglement game mode, players have three types of moves:

1. **Classical Move**: Similar to the classical Tic-Tac-Toe, players place their symbols on the board.

2. **Entanglement Move**: This move allows players to entangle two positions on the board. If either of the entangled positions is occupied by a player's symbol, the other position gets automatically occupied by the same symbol.

3. **Measurement Move**: After entangling positions, players perform a measurement move to determine the outcome of the entanglement.
